### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer located in Toronto and I enjoy all aspects of the software development process. Things I value the most are security, resiliency, performance, scalability and automation, and it's my goal to reflect all these values in my work.

Projects I worked on:
- [Udacity Data Engineering with Docker and IoC with Terraform. Easy to setup (WIP)](https://github.com/JialunC/Udacity-Data-Engineering)

  While I was studying Udacity Data Engineering with materials posted on Github by students who bought the course, I was annoyed by how all the provisioning is not automated / scriptified. I use Docker to spin up different applications like Postgres, Cassandra, Jupyter notebooks, etc., and created IoC for AWS resources like Redshift, S3 to ensure easy deploy and a complete clean teardown.

- [AWS Cognito IoC (WIP)](https://github.com/JialunC/toolbox-aws-cognito)

  Toolbox item to setup Cognito on AWS with Terraform, with different idps (social, OIDC) examples.

- [Celery service with flower](https://github.com/JialunC/toolbox-celery-flower)

  Toolbox item to setup a easy-to-use and easy-to-setup Celery boilerplate, with ECS Fargate support.
  
- [A Flask boilerplate service for identity management](https://github.com/JialunC/toolbox-jwt-auth-flask)

  Toolbox item to setup a Flask service for managing users, with JWT auth.
